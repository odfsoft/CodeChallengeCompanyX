This task is about having different fish species, which like to eat each other. The different species are never eating fishes of the same species and they are only able to eat specific other species.
The following list describes the fish species known (together with it's abbreviation used in the input String) and the other species, that this species is eating. 

* Shark (A) eats Salmon (B) and Herring (C) 
* Salmon (B) eats Herring (C) and Sardine (D) 
* Herring (C) eats Sardine (D) 
* Sardine (D) is too small and eats no other fish

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
```

that, given a string S describing a row of fishes, returns an integer that gives the number of fishes surviving, after all fishes have eaten their neighbors, that they are able to eat. The function has to be applied, until there are no neighbours available any longer, that could be eaten. Also the function should find the smallest number of surviving fishes, if there are several possible sequences of eating the neighbours.
Assume that:
* Length of String S is in range of [0..1.000.000] 
* Every character in String S is out of the list: 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' 
  
For example:
- Given a String "ABAD" the result will be 3, 
because the sharks will eat the Salmon and the rest will survive.
- Given a String "ACCD" the result will be 1, 
because the Herring will eat the Sardine and the Shark will finally eat the Herrings.
