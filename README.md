# Code Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to multiple coding challenges in Java.

Codility
- Lessons
- Yearly Challenges
- Companies provided challenges

Directory Structure:
```
- README.md: contains the problem statement
- ExcerciseName.java: contains the solution to the challenge e.g. CyclicRotation.java
- ExcerciseNameTest.java: contains test cases for the solution e.g.t CyclicRotationTest.java
```
having the test cases next to the actual solution makes it easy for me to navigate between them 
instead of using the IDE navigation.
